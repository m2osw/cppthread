cppthread (1.1.12.0~bionic) bionic; urgency=high

  * Made the testme plugin test work.
  * Removed the CATCH_CHECK() from the plugin. Version 3.x complains about it.
  * Enhanced the plugin test by calling the it_worked() function (made virtual).
  * Changed version verification, if negative, fail.
  * Added the GLOB_FLAG_EMPTY to allow for no files when globbing.
  * Actually install the plugins.h header file.
  * Made the plugin_definition structs work properly when undefined.
  * Enhanced error message if you created a plugin but no such class factory.
  * Link the SNAPCATCH2 libray to the testme plugin (although at this point
    that's not useful since it is considered _detached_).
  * Various clean ups (docs, function order).
  * Added a plugin::do_update() function to better support snapwebsites.
  * Force you to have a "server" plugin in your main application to load
    other plugins. This way you gain access to that server automatically.
  * Instead of a data pointer, we give the plugin access to the collection
    and thus the server and other plugins.
  * The collection() still has a data pointer, see `get_data<T>()`.
  * Added our old boost::signal2 macros to use such in our plugins.
