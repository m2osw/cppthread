* Implement many more tests to get to full coverage.

* Have a scheme where a job for a worker thread is given a date when to be
  run. This allows us to pace some jobs with a single thread. When a job is
  performed and we are ready for the paced next step, read the packet with
  a NOW + N seconds as the new job's date (i.e. instead of just a plain
  wait() we use a timed_wait() which allows us to wake up and take care of
  a lingering packet).
